# python-zarafa
This was the home of the development snapshot of python-zarafa for ZCP 7.1

# Please read this carefully
Since ZCP 7.2 python-zarafa has been delivered as part of the ZCP core.

As most customers have migrated to 7.2 the need to have a python-zarafa available for older ZCP versions has greatly diminished.

The 7.2 version as delivered with ZCP has gone through a lot of development to add the functionality which was required to implement advanced features.

As a result of these changes the GitHub "7.1" version is no longer compatible with the 7.2 version.

## What do I need to do
### If you are running ZCP 7.2
Please make sure you have removed the manually installed version of python-zarafa, having both installed will **break** functionality.

### If you are running ZCP 7.1
Please upgrade to ZCP 7.2 if you want to be able to continue to use python-zarafa with its many new features.

## Documentation
The current documentation can be found at https://documentation.zarafa.com/zcp_python_zarafa/

## Example scripts
The scripts in the scripts will remain here for educational purposes.
Please keep in mind that could be they are no longer compatible with the python-zarafa as shipped with ZCP 7.2
